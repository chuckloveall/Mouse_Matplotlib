# Mouse_Matplotlib
## Purpose
Analysis of fictional drug study in mice. 249 mice are studied with base tumor volume taken and given various drug treatments. The purpose of the study is to evaluate Capomulin versus other treatment regimens. 

## Method
Checked data for mouse ID duplicate and removed data with duplicates. There was one mouse that had such data, and that data is deleted and shown for reference. 
Generated a summary statistics table with mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM for tumor volume on each drug regimen. 
Generated identical bar plots showing the number of measurements taken using both Pandas and Matplotlib. 
Generated identical pie plots showing the distribution of gender in the mice using both Pandas and Matplotlib.
Calculated the final tumor volume across the four regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. 
Calculate quartiles, IQR and outliers, plotting the four regimens on a single boxplot. Highlighted the outlier with a special style. 
Generated a graph of a single mouse on Capomulin and its tumor volume vs time. 
Generated a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume on the Capomulin regimen. 
Calculate the correlation coefficient and plot the linear regression between mouse weight and mean tumor volume.
